# Typical Vertices

Compute and display the combinations of regular polygons that can tile around a common vertex. For such a tiling, the internal angles of the polygons must sum to 360 degrees.

> There are seventeen combinations of regular polygons whose internal angles add up to 360 degrees, each being referred to as a _species_ of vertex; in four cases there are two distinct cyclic orders of the polygons, yielding twenty-one _types_ of vertex.
